# Web extension (experimental)

Cody for VS Code is currently only intended for use in VS Code Desktop, not [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev) or other web-based variants of VS Code.

However, intrepid developers can use the _highly experimental_ web extension variant for local development, using either of these 2 methods:

- Run `pnpm run watch:dev:web` and then open http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.
- In VS Code, run the `Launch VS Code Extension (Web, in Browser)` debug configuration.

Running the extension in this way is not officially supported or formally tested.

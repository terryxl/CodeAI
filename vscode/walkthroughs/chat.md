Answer questions about general programming topics, or specific to your codebase, with Cody chat. You can choose between LLMs, @-mentions files and symbols, and enable enhanced repository-wide code context.

You can start a chat at any time using the default keyboard shortcut of `Option` `/` on macOS and `Alt` `/` on Windows & Linux.

**✨ Pro-tips for using Cody chat**
<br>• Enabling “Enhanced Context”, and tagging specific files and symbols, gives the selected LLM more context to help answer your questions more accurately.
<br>• If you want to chat directly with the LLM without any additional context adding, disable "Enhanced Context".
<br>• You can increase the quality of your chat responses by enabling "Search Context (Beta)" in your [Cody Settings](command:cody.status-bar.interacted).

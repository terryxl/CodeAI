Cody builds a Search index of your local files to make it easier to find what you’re looking for. Use a natural language query like “password hashing” or "connection retries" to quickly find and open the files that match your search.

**✨ Pro-tips for using Cody’s Natural Language Search**
<br>• Increase the quality of your chat responses by enabling "Search Context (Beta)" in your [Cody Settings](command:cody.status-bar.interacted). This enables chat to use the natural language search index as a context source.
<br>• You can search file and symbol names too, not just natural language queries.

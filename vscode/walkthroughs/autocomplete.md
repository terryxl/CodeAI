Start writing code and Cody will complete the line (or the entire function) for you. Hit tab to accept the suggestion.

**✨ Pro-tips for using Cody autocomplete**
<br>• Autocomplete uses the surrounding code and context to inform the suggestions, so if you need to guide it you can add a comment above the line you're editing.
<br>• You can hover over the grey suggestion to see a toolbar of alternative suggestions, as well as other options such as accepting a single word at a time.
<br>• You can use the "Trigger Autocomplete at Cursor" command to trigger a code suggestion at any time, using the default keyboard shortcut of `Option` `\` on macOS and `Alt` `\` on Windows & Linux.
